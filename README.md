## What is Panda? 

Panda is a program written and running in [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/). It enables algorithmic sound processing in realtime for both composition and performance. It can be used as a standalone software via a its graphical user interface, but can also be easily integrated into and extended by other Pd-programs. Most generally speaking, Panda can be seen as a sequencer for algorithms rather than soundfiles.

## Quickstart

If you want to use Panda, simply install [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/) (Pd) on your computer. Pd is free and cross-platform (Linux/Mac/Windows). Then download Panda and place it in a directory where Pd will find it. (On unix systems this will usually be the ,,Pd"-directory in your home directory.) On Linux, you can use ,,Panda.desktop" to integrate Panda into your launcher. Otherwise, simply load ,,Panda.pd" from Pd.
